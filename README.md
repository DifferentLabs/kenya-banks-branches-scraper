# kenya-banks-branches-scraper
Scrapes list of kenyan banks

This gets a list of banks , their respective branches .. and the branch code from http://www.kba.co.ke/bankcodes/index.html and outputs it in json and  xml

I made is because i needed the informarion for a project and i figured someone else might need it too. Made it in a rush so excuse the funky code.

Just incase you dont want to parse the inf yourself , check out the xml and json data here https://github.com/DifferentLabs/kenya-bank-branch-info
